        <h3>16.2 Informal Negotiations</h3>

        <p>Before initiating any formal dispute resolution process, you agree to first contact us at <strong>treehouseofficialteam@gmail.com</strong> and attempt to resolve the dispute informally. Both parties agree to negotiate in good faith for a period of at least thirty (30) days before proceeding to arbitration or litigation.</p>

        <h3>16.3 Binding Arbitration</h3>

        <p>If the dispute cannot be resolved through informal negotiations, you agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the App shall be resolved by binding arbitration conducted in Cook County, Illinois, in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA).</p>

        <h3>16.4 Arbitration Costs</h3>

        <p>If arbitration fees are deemed excessive by the arbitrator, we agree to pay such fees to ensure the dispute resolution process remains accessible to you.</p>

        <h3>16.5 Exceptions to Arbitration</h3>

        <p>Notwithstanding the above, either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party's intellectual property rights.</p>

        <h3>16.6 Class Action Waiver</h3>

        <p>YOU AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND TREEHOUSE INDIVIDUALLY. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW:</p>

        </ul>

        <h3>16.7 Jurisdiction for Litigation</h3>

        <h3>16.8 Time Limitation on Claims</h3>

        <p>Any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of the App or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, or it will be forever barred, regardless of any statute or law to the contrary.</p>

        <h3>17.3 No Waiver</h3>

        <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision does not constitute a waiver of that right.</p>

        <h3>17.4 Assignment</h3>

        <p>You may not assign these Terms without our consent. We may assign these Terms at any time.</p>

        <h3>17.5 No Third-Party Beneficiaries</h3>
